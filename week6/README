install MPLAB x IDE 
it will prompt you to install X32 compiler
file->new project->microchip embedded->select PIC32MX250F128B->select simulation
on the left side you see a tab named projects
inside the folder Header files add fonts.h, i2cmaster.h and ssd1306.h (they are all c header files)
inside the folder source files add newmain.c , i2cmaster.c and ssd1306.c (they are all c source files)

whatever changes you want to do, do inside newmain.c
when reading newmain.c whatever functions you cant find there you can find inside the other source files
Instead of OLED incase LCD is being used or incase you want more characters than A-Z, a-z and 0-9 and few special characters fonts.h will also have to be changed
